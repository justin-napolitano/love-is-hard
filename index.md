# To Will The Good In The Other

I watched a youtube video once about "what is love?". I listened to a Roman Catholic Bishop discuss St. Thomas Acquinas' understanding of love. To will the good in the other.. to let go of oneself in order to will for good in the person that one loves. This is hard.

## Love is Hard

I am living through one of those periods in my life where I have to overcome myself in order to meet the demands of reality.  I think to me this means that what I want is not necessarily what God will give. It sucks.  

## Connection

I want more than just a connection. I want to feel fullfilled. I want more from life than consumption, fucking, and instagram stories. Maybe there is nothing more? I do not know anymore. 

## A family

I would love a family. I have wanted my own.. I have had my own.  I am a fool for running away from it.. but I am a fool with sense of self respect. I might just be trying to rationalize my behavior here. Self respect might just be arrogance in disguise.

## Cancer

I do feel condemned. I want a wife.. I want children.. I want a family.. Moreso than anyting in my life.. I want a family. A family that will inherit my condemnation.  It feels wrong.  

## Peace

There might be a sense of peace I can find in myself if I forgo a family. If I forgo chasing a dream that is not meant to be, I might find some peace. I fear however I will die alone.. Fuck I will die again.. this time without my mother by my side. 

## And So It Goes

And what am I to do? Life is hard.. Love is hard.. God is cold.. We all die alone.. Even if surrounded by the ones we love. So accept things as they are.. smile.. and put another foot in front of the other. Be thankful for those two feet.
